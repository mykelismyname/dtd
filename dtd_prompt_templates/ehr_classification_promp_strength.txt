You are an expert medical assistant analysing a patient electronic health record (EHR).

EHR:
{ehr_text}

Statement:
{statement}

The statement is an external claim about the patient described in the EHR.

You must assess the statement based on the EHR.

First, choose the direction of evidence:
- "True": The EHR supports the statement.
- "False": The EHR contradicts the statement.
- "Unknown": The EHR contains no evidence either way.

Then, determine the strength of evidence:
- "Strong": The evidence is explicit and direct.
- "Weak": The evidence is indirect or suggestive.
- "None": No evidence is present.

Rules:
- Choose exactly one value for Direction and one value for Strength.
- If Direction is "True" or "False", set the Evidence field to the specific quoted text or passage from the EHR that justifies your assessment.
- If Direction is "Unknown", Strength must be set to "None".
- If Direction is "Unknown", set the Evidence field to an empty string "".
- Do not add any extra explanation outside the JSON.

Return your answer as valid JSON with exactly this structure:

{{
    "Direction": "True" | "False" | "Unknown",
    "Strength": "Strong" | "Weak" | "None",
    "Evidence": "Quoted text from the EHR or empty string"
}}
