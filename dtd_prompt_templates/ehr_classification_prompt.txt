You are an expert medical assistant analysing a patient electronic health record (EHR).

EHR:
{ehr_text}

Statement:
{statement}

The statement is an external claim about the patient described in the EHR.

You must assess the truth of the statement based on the EHR and choose exactly one of the following outcomes:
- "True": There is evidence in the EHR that the statement is true.
- "False": There is evidence in the EHR that the statement is false.
- "Unknown": The EHR does not contain enough information to determine whether the statement is true or false.

Rules:
- Choose exactly one of "True", "False", or "Unknown".
- If the Direction field is "True" or "False", set the Evidence field to the specific quoted text or passage from the EHR that justifies your conclusion.
- If you choose "Unknown", set the Evidence field to an empty string "".
- Do not add any extra explanation outside the JSON.

Return your answer as valid JSON with exactly this structure:

{{
    "Conclusion": "True" | "False" | "Unknown",
    "Evidence": "Quoted text from the EHR or empty string"
}}
